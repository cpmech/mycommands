# My LaTeX commands (mycommands)

This repository collects a number of LaTeX commands used in my papers and reports.

These commands help with typing works in Tensor Calculus, Continuum Mechanics, and the Finite Element Method.

Add mycommands and so on to the TEXINPUTS environment variable (this should go into `~/.bash_aliases`):
```
export TEXINPUTS=$TEXINPUTS:$HOME/replace-this/mycommands
```
MAKE SURE TO REPLACE *replace-this* with the directory where you downloaded *mycommands*

## Inkscape plugin

Directory _inkscape-plugin_ contains a slightly modified version of this great plugin (https://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/)

These files should go into `~/.config/inkscape/extensions`
