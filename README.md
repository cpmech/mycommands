# My LaTeX commands (mycommands)

This repository collects a number of LaTeX commands used in my papers and reports.

These commands help with typing works in Tensor Calculus, Continuum Mechanics, and the Finite Element Method.

Add mycommands and so on to the TEXINPUTS environment variable:
```
export TEXINPUTS=":$HOME/pkg/mycommands:"
```

## Inkscape plugin

Directory _inkscape-plugin_ contains a slightly modified version of this great plugin (https://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/)
